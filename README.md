# frank_wolfe_step_selection
Repo for Optimization Project on exploration of step size algorithms for Frank-Wolfe optimization algorithm [^1]. The algorithms we explored were:
- Trivial stepsize: $\frac{2}{k + 2}$
- Demyanov-Rubinov step-size [^2]
- Backtracking line-search [^3]
- Armijo step-size [^4]
